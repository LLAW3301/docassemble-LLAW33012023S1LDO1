# The Amending Order Tool

The Amending Order Tool was created by Flinders University Students in collaboration with the Legislative Drafting Office of Jersey, to assist their drafters with creating 'Amending Orders' - the official documents that codify amendments to legislation.

## Key Features

* Utilises the Legislative Drafting Office's standard amending language to prepare textual amendments to existing legislation, including the simple insertion, deletion or substitution of text. 
* Generates Amending Orders that adhere to the legal formatting required by the Government of Jersey, and contain amendments as entered by the user. 
* Minimises the occurrence of human error and inconsistencies within Amending Orders.
* Reduces the time required to draft Amending Orders.
